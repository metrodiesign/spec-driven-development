# gate-task.test.sh — adversarial test for the task-boundary quality gate.
# Run: bash .claude/hooks/tests/gate-task.test.sh   (exit 0 = all passed)
#
# Logic lives in .ai/bin/gate-task.sh (the single-source engine); .claude/hooks/
# task-gate.sh, .codex/hooks/task-gate.sh and .opencode/plugins/task-gate.js are thin
# adapters that hand the engine an input shape (scoped flipped hunk OR whole file).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES (PR #24 findings #6, #19, #20, #28):
#   #6  — all THREE adapter input shapes (Claude scoped hunk, Codex added-lines,
#         OpenCode whole-file) yield the SAME engine verdict for the same flip.
#   #19 — the Evidence check is PER TASK: a pre-existing Evidence line on a DIFFERENT
#         task does NOT satisfy a freshly-flipped task that has none of its own.
#   #20/#28 — Evidence must be non-trivial content; the Claude Write path no longer
#         auto-injects a synthetic 'Evidence: n/a (Write path)', so a [x] flip written
#         via Write with no real Evidence blocks exactly like Edit/OpenCode.
#
# ISOLATION: the engine runs typecheck + test (npm) BEFORE the Evidence gate. To test
# the Evidence logic deterministically (and not depend on a green tsc/vitest env), each
# case runs the engine inside a throwaway sandbox dir whose package.json stubs
# `typecheck` and `test` to no-ops (exit 0). The gate file path is a real
# .claude/specs/<feature>/tasks.md shape so the engine's path filter fires. We assert
# exit code only (2 = block, 0 = allow); npm/git are never run for real against the repo.
