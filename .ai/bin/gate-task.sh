# gate-task.sh — harness-agnostic task-boundary quality gate (.ai/bin engine)
# Ported from .claude/hooks/task-gate.sh. The code-green check is STACK-AGNOSTIC: a project
# declares its typecheck/test commands via $SDD_TYPECHECK_CMD / $SDD_TEST_CMD, and a Node
# project that ships package.json scripts is auto-detected for backward-compat; when neither
# is present the check is skipped and only the Evidence gate applies. The Evidence check is
# PER TASK (scoped to each flipped [x] region) and requires non-trivial content, so every
# adapter input shape yields the same verdict (PR #24 findings #6/#19/#20/#28).
#
# Fires only when a .ai/specs/*/tasks.md (or legacy .claude/specs/*/) checkbox is being flipped to [x].
# เขียว = เงียบ exit 0, แดง = exit 2 + stderr ให้แก้ก่อน mark เสร็จ
#
# Interface (harness-agnostic):
#   $1 / $GATE_FILE      = tasks.md file path being edited
#   $2 / $GATE_NEW       = the new_string / content the edit introduces (the flip text).
#                          May be a scoped flipped hunk (Claude/Codex) OR the whole
#                          post-edit file (OpenCode) — the engine scopes Evidence PER
#                          TASK so the verdict is IDENTICAL across those input shapes.
# The caller's adapter is responsible for extracting these from its own hook payload.
# When $GATE_NEW carries a "- [x]" line it is treated as a flip; a NON-TRIVIAL Evidence:
# block is then required INSIDE THE REGION of EACH flipped [x] task (not just somewhere
# in the input). A pre-existing Evidence line belonging to a different task therefore
# cannot satisfy the gate for a task that has none of its own.

# nor a matching package.json script exists, the check is skipped and only the Evidence gate
# (below) applies. Commands are operator-provided config, run via eval to honor their quoting.
